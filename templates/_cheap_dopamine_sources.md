# _Cheap_ dopamine sources

- ⬜️ YT. Sad but true. Perhaps we'll need a new account because this one ruined anyway
- ⬜️ TG channels and chats. All with news, chit-chats, politics. Exceptions: workgroups, service notifications, and all the stuff we need in our jobs
- ⬜️ 🐤 should be uninstalled too
- ⬜️ To be continued

P.S.: if you're not a blogger of something.
