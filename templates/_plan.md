# So what's the plan?

## Day 1 - know your enemy that kills your focus time

- ‚¨úÔ∏è Write down the list of your personal _cheap_ dopamine sources

- - Messengers' channels, chats or groups
- - Youtube subscriptions
- - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and all the stuff

First of all we need to cut out any news, chit-chats, useless image and video scrolling.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è Know your focus time

For example, 9a.m. - 6p.m. with one hour lunch break

## Day 2 - notifications are bad for your health

- ‚¨úÔ∏è Set up (basically, turn off) notifications

- - ‚¨úÔ∏è Write down the whitelist of persons - family, friends, relatives and all the emergency contacts
- - ‚¨úÔ∏è Write down apps whitelist - team communications apps, calendars (we're not gonna miss budget meeting, right?)
- - ‚¨úÔ∏è Turn all the other notifications off (at least at your focus time)

## Day 3 - How can I fill this void?

Set up your goals for upcoming week, it might be

- ‚¨úÔ∏è Read book you wanted to
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Plan your gym trainings for next month, have 2 real ones
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Plan CCNP certification (with all the dates and resourses)
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Visit dentist, get the treatment plan (dates, money)
- ‚úÖ Learn and get first touch on something completely new, like Azure SQL databases

## Day 4 - Speaking of exceptions

Some communication channels might be vital for your business. Let sort them out:

- ‚úÖ team / project chats

Anyway we need to think hard on notifications strategy. Do I really need to be notified instantly? Or maybe "once an hour" can be better option. Or even "once a day", why not.

- ‚úÖ shiny new youtube profile with all the "healthy" videos

like educational videos, some courses, "how to" guides. Previous profile traces must be cleaned up from browser(s) in use or maybe it's just time to try new browser right now. Or even two new browsers üßê

- üìµ direct phone calls must be banned

as for me, but of course it's up to you. Or at least good "near" circle is a small one.   
Same question here - do I really need to talk right now or we could send a message each other and read it at more convenient time?

## Day 5 - good sleep is a key to success

A lot of words had been said on sleep quality and its amount. Most of them are true. That is why you need to:
- keep tracking your sleep (use journal, reflex your condition every morning)
- provide cosy environment (silence, windows shadowing etc.)
- go to bed at the same time
- maintain information purity an hour before bedtime (no displays!)

## Day X - surprise! üò≤

To get the prise we need to do some hard job. But there is really nothing to do, actually, you'll see
