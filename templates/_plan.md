# So what's the plan?

## Week 1

### Day 1 - know your enemy that kills your focus time

- ⬜️ Write down the list of your personal _cheap_ dopamine sources

- - Messengers' channels, chats or groups
- - Youtube subscriptions
- - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and all the stuff

First of all we need to cut out of any news, chit-chats, useless image and video scrolling.

- ⬜️ Know your focus time

For example, 9a.m. - 6p.m. with one hour lunch break

### Day 2 - notifications are bad for your health

- ⬜️ Set up (basically, turn off) notifications

- - ⬜️ Write down the whitelist of persons - family, friends, relatives and all the emergency contacts
- - ⬜️ Write down apps whitelist - team communications apps, calendars (we're not gonna miss budget meeting, right?)
- - ⬜️ Turn all the other notifications of (at least at your focus time)
