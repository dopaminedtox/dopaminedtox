Hi there 👋

# What is it for?

So what is the problem? Nowadays, we keep getting _cheap_ dopamine from social media. Meh, is it a problem at all? Try to get pleasure from reading a book or completing your work or personal project. Did it work out well? Good, you're lucky. It didn't? Well, at least you're not alone.

# Do I need it?

- ✅ Wanna start reading books. Again. Because I like reading books
- ✅ Completing projects is fun, I'm in
- ✅ Completing pet-projects fun too
- ✅ I need to get certificated this quarter, but IG is so addictive
- ✅ Deadlines are all about me, but man, have you heard how many kittens are dying daily because of those politicians?
- ✅ Social media take too much time. I might've got a walk with my kids
- ✅ I wanna be able to concentrate on one task for at least 30 minutes
- ✅ All of those sounds boring. I'd better scroll youtube recommendations
- 🤷🏼‍♂️ I'm not sure if this is a problem for me, I'm pretty good at completing tasks
- ❎ Thanks, you know I'm something of a doctor myself
