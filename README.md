Hi there 👋

# TLDR

[This plan](./templates/_plan.md) is being generated right now 

# What is it for?

So what is the problem? Nowadays, we keep getting _cheap_ dopamine from social media. Meh, is it a problem at all? Try to get pleasure from reading a book or completing your work or personal project. Did it work out well? Good, you're lucky. It didn't? Well, at least you're not alone.

# Do I need it?

- ✅ Wanna start reading books. Again. Because I like reading books
- ✅ Completing projects is fun, I'm in
- ✅ Completing pet-projects fun too
- ✅ I need to get certificated this quarter, but IG is so addictive
- ✅ Deadlines are all about me, but man, have you heard how many kittens are dying daily because of those politicians?
- ✅ Social media take too much time. I might've got a walk with my kids
- ✅ I wanna be able to concentrate on one task for at least 30 minutes
- ✅ All of those sounds boring. I'd better scroll youtube recommendations
- 🤷🏼‍♂️ I'm not sure if this is a problem for me, I'm pretty good at completing tasks
- ❎ Thanks, you know I'm something of a doctor myself

# DoD

# To do

- ⬜️ Define what _cheap_ dopamine is whatever

```
brain fuel
---------- = dopamine price
 pleasue
```

Every work we trying to do (or though we trying to think) consumes kinda "brain fuel" and gives us some pleasue.   
The less fuel we waste on getting the same amount of please, the _cheaper_ dopamine is.
