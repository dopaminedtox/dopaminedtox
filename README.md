Hi there 👋

# TLDR

[This plan](./templates/_plan.md) is being generated right now 

# What is it for?

So what is the problem? Nowadays, we keep getting _cheap_ dopamine from social media. Is it a problem at all? Try to get pleasure from reading a book or completing your work or personal project. Did it work out well? Good, you're lucky. It didn't? Well, at least you're not alone.

# Do I need it?

## You do if:

- ✅ You want to start reading books. Again. Because you like reading books
- ✅ You forgot that completing projects is fun
- ✅ Completing pet-projects fun too
- ✅ Need to get certificated this quarter, but IG is so addictive
- ✅ Deadlines are all about you, but "have you heard how many kittens are dying daily because of those politicians"?
- ✅ Social media takes too much of your time. You might've got a walk with kids
- ✅ You want to be able to concentrate on one task for at least 30 minutes
- ✅ All of the above sounds boring. I'd better scroll youtube recommendations

## Perhaps do not if:

- 🤷🏼‍♂️ You're not sure if this is a problem at all, you're pretty good at completing tasks

## I (the author) need your help if:

- ❎ "Thanks, you know I'm something of a doctor myself"

# Definitions of done

- 😍 I've enjoyed last book. And I get some notes while reading
- 🧐 CCNE non pen*s canis est
- 👦🏼 Daddy, stop climbing this mountain, we've already been here! We'd better watch "Star Wars" again!
- 👩🏻‍⚕️ "Thanks, you know I'm something of a doctor myself"

# To do

- ✅ Define what _cheap_ dopamine is

```
brain fuel
---------- = dopamine price
 pleasue
```

Every work we are trying to do (or ideas we are trying to think on) consumes kinda "brain fuel" and gives us some pleasue.   
The less fuel we waste on getting the same amount of pleasure, the _cheaper_ dopamine is.
